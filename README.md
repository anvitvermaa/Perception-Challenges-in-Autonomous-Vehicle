# 🚗 Perception Challenges in Autonomous Vehicles  

## 📄 Overview  
This research paper explores the key **perception challenges** faced by **autonomous vehicles (AVs)**, focusing on:  
- **Sensor Fusion Issues:** Integrating data from Lidar, Radar, and Cameras to create a coherent environment model.  
- **Object Detection & Classification:** Handling **occlusions, edge cases, and dynamic object tracking**.  
- **Adversarial Attacks & Security Risks:** The impact of **AI manipulation, GPS spoofing, and sensor hacking** on AV safety.  
- **Environmental Perception in Adverse Conditions:** Overcoming **fog, rain, and low-light challenges**.  
- **Ethical & Legal Concerns:** Addressing **privacy, liability, and decision-making dilemmas** in AV technology.  

## 🛠️ Key Technologies & Concepts  
- **Sensor Fusion** → Combining Lidar, Radar, and Camera data.  
- **Machine Learning for Object Detection** → YOLO, Faster R-CNN, and CNNs.  
- **Localization & Mapping** → SLAM, GPS, and High-Definition Maps.  
- **Depth Estimation & Semantic Segmentation** → Computer vision-based scene understanding.  
- **Cybersecurity in AVs** → Adversarial ML attacks, data privacy, and ethical concerns.
